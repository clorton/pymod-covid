In this app, we want to demonstrate how fertility and mortality are configured in the DTK code.
We will start with a population of 10k (?) of uniform age. We'll let the user set the fertility 
and morality params, or walk them through the options. We will run for 1 year when they hit 'submit' 
and report back the births and/or deaths.
For births, we'll record the time of each birth and render that in a monthly bar chart on its side.
For deaths, we'll do the same, but render the age (and gender?) in a monthly bar chart.
